BOGGLE VARIANTS:

First version of this boggle game will implement the "New Boggle" variant. Once I have a working version, I will add the
other variants.

As I discovered when I started researching boggle letter frequency, there are multiple versions of Boggle, which are:
Classic Boggle
New Boggle
Big Boggle
Super Big Boggle

Classic Boggle was developed in the 1970s. It uses 16 dice (4x4 board) with the following letter combinations:

```
AACIOT
ABILTY
ABJMOQu
ACDEMP
ACELRS
ADENVZ
AHMORS
BIFORX
DENOSW
DKNOTU
EEFHIY
EGKLUY
EGINTV
EHINPS
ELPSTU
GILRUW
```

New Boggle (the version sold since ~2008, according to the internet) was created to address some problems in the letter
frequency of Classic Boggle. Its 16 dice have the following letter combinations:

```
AAEEGN
ABBJOO
ACHOPS
